WORK_START
Amount of work you did on the project:
	1) Work done on each sprint

	2) Work done on project: count user stories, a quick glance to determine if they are reasonable. 
		If listing many small things, use a .5 factor
WORK_END
WORK: /???

CODEQUALITY_START
Code quality: Individual classes marked according to 5 mark grading scheme, code marking scheme.
	
	1) Please make your code so simple, with names so well chosen, that minimal documentation is needed. 

		Check use of naming convention for mapping between 
			Name on Rectangle Button
			Rectangle
			filenames for Rectangle ICONS
			classes involving Rectangle

		[YN] Images named according to mode/shape (based on simple convention)
		[YN] Classes named according to mode/shape

		Check for names of classes that mention which design pattern they are using
			*Factory*
			*Strategy*
			*Command*

		[YN] Classes named according to design pattern

	2) 
		[YN] Code is simple: 
			Example: methods appropriately short and serve a specific purpose
			Example: classes appropriately short and serve a specific purpose
			Example: uses correct few concepts effectively
			Example: captures concepts in methods and classes

		[YN] Code is clear and clean
			Example: documenting interesting algorithms
			Example: No deeply nested if
			Example: Good naming
			Example: easy to understand if conditions
			Example: Easy to see what a variable is used for
			Example: Easy to find your way around code
			Example: Ask whats going on here, its easy to understand based on names, doc, 
				mention paradigm and then code matches paradigm.

			Example: no commented out code left in etc.
			Example: code is nicely organized and indented for easy reading.
			Example: Methods that work together appear together

		[YN] Code is concise
			Example: Minimal repeated code

	3) instanceof OR is instance
		The following is 3 marks, all or nothing. 
		MARKER: Look for chained if statements/switch in code. Look for instance of or isinstance
	
		[YN] No mention of isInstance/instanceof/switching on some class name
		[YN] No mention of isInstance/instanceof/switching on some class name
		[YN] No mention of isInstance/instanceof/switching on some class name

CODEQUALITY: /9

ARCHITECTURE_START
Architecture: The extent to which you use Design Patterns to create simple, extendable, clear, concise code.

	1) Count if they specifically have:
		CHECK: finalArchitecture/architecture.txt

		BUG?.003 Architecture behind choosing selection mode is poor
		[YN] Factory: When the ShapeSelector Button is pressed
		[YN] Strategy: Handling mouse events

		BUG3.004 Architecture behind Model is poor
		[YN] Command: For a stack of shape commands. 

			CHECK: PaintModel, they have a collection of Shape with Shape.paint(GraphicsContext g2d) or similar.


	2) marked from finalArchitecture/architecture.txt, count number of ADDITIONAL design patterns they architected.

		POINTS: 
		1) Use of library DP does not count, example Observer/Observable or Iterator. For example,
		   claiming that the listeners is Observer/Observable does not count.

		2) If you re-created Iterator or Observer/Observable this does not count.

		3) To count, it should make a difference, just using a linked list when there is an ArrayList
		   will not make the code better.
		
		MARKER NOTE: Please list the design patterns you accepted from their finalArchitecture/architecture.txt
		MARKER NOTE: Accept a maximum of the best 3

		[YN] Additional DP
		[YN] Additional DP
		[YN] Additional DP

ARCHITECTURE_END
ARCHITECTURE: /6

GIT_START
Git: We expect to see simultaneous working branches merging into master, moving the project forward.
	1) branches on BUG/US
		[YN] list of branches named according to US/BUG

	2) quality of git log --graph 
		[YN] clean git graph (branches and merges)
GIT_END
GIT: /2

DOCUMENTATION_START
Documentation: 
	1) In addition to normal JavaDoc, please make sure that you describe how classes are used in any Design Patterns. 

		From repo_a2_XXX/Assignment2/scrum/finalArchitecture/architecture.txt

		[YN] Describes one scenario/story
		[YN] Clearly describes one scenario/story (all details needed to follow and implement)


	3) Additionally, you will be marked on your architecture documents as submitted in Sprint1 and Sprint4.

		Marks from Prof. Zhang
